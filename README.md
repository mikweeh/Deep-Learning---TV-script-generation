# TV Script Generation

## Introduction

This is a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) project as part of Udacity's nanodegree Deep Learning. It uses LSTM. It generates Seinfeld TV scripts. You'll be using part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The built Neural Network generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.


## Getting the project files

The project files can be found in our public GitHub repo, in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer using:

git clone https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning-v2-pytorch.git

This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

You may also choose to complete your project using the provided, in-classroom project notebook; this will just require that you run the project notebook, and download the complete files, as specified below.
